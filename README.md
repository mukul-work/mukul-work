# Hi, I'm Mukul 👋

I'm a Computer Science undergraduate focused on building strong fundamentals in
**JavaScript, Web Development, and Software Engineering**.

I’m currently working through **The Odin Project** and building practical,
end-to-end projects with clean code and clear documentation.

## 🔧 Skills
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML, CSS
- Git & GitHub
- Linux basics

## 📌 Projects
Here are a few projects I'm proud of:
- **Etch-a-Sketch** – A browser-based drawing app built with vanilla JavaScript, demonstrating DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic grid rendering.
- **Calculator** – A fully functional calculator implementing core arithmetic logic, state management, and edge-case handling using plain JavaScript.

## 📈 What I'm Focused On
- Writing readable, maintainable code
- Finishing projects properly (not tutorials)
- Building a strong public engineering portfolio
